# osx-us-altgr-intl

This is an adaptation of the Xorg US keymap "altgr-intl" variant for OSX. More information can be found [here](https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2007-July/026534.html) and [here](https://zuttobenkyou.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/xorg-using-the-us-international-altgr-intl-variant-keyboard-layout/).

# Usage

```
sudo cp us-altgr-intl.keylayout /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
```

A reboot is probably necessary for the new keymap to appear in Preferences/Keyboard.

This has been tested with OSX Mojave 10.14.6.

# Improvements

Basics are here for my own usage but diacritics combinations (dead-keys mode overlappings) are probably missing. Any improvement is welcome. This file has been developped with Ukulele for a US ANSI keyboard.
